    <p className="mb-4"><i>If you can recognize competition as a destructive force instead of a sign of value, you’re already more sane than most. — Zero to one, Peter Thiel.</i></p>

<p className="mb-4">Our society heavily incentivizes us to accumulate an ever-extending list of achievements. 
It makes for a stronger profile and sets you apart. Parents and teachers reward you if you stand first in class. 
There are a lot of intangible consequences involved, including gains in your social status and egotism.</p>
<br />
<p className="mb-4">Competition in sports and capitalistic markets helps people push themselves to achieve feats that would 
have been unimaginable otherwise. The classic example is — The early 1900s when we saw rapid advancements in medicine and 
technology due to the World War.</p>
<br />
<h2 className="mb-4">The 2 sides of the spectrum.</h2>

<p className="mb-4">Despite the apparent merits of being competitive, society is built on cooperation and not through competition. 
Getting ahead in zero-sum games serves no one other than your vanity. Maybe you were able to make massive breakthroughs in the process 
of competing.</p><br />

<p className="mb-4"> Counterfactually, these improvements could have been much greater if you worked with people rather than against them. 
One could argue that an individual loses the intrinsic motivation to push themselves with the lack of competition. Unfortunately, 
ditching others behind to move forward as a primary motivation has toxic byproducts.</p>
<br />
<h2 className="mb-4">Should you highlight it as a strength?</h2>

<p className="mb-4">Why does our society consider being competitive as a virtue? Hypothetically, if I was a recruiter, mentioning the point — “I am competitive” as a personal strength would leave me a little confused. It highlights how the candidate views the world as a cluster of competitive games, where all key performance indicators are measured relative to the other players. On a practical note, most jobs involve working in teams, so this would obviously classify as a red flag. Most people mistake the quality of being ambitious for competitiveness. Moving forward does not mean you leave other people behind.</p>
<br />
<p className="mb-4">It’s time we start encouraging students to focus on building and not competing. Securing the first position should not be a benchmark for exceptional performance. In this hyper-competitive world, we must foster a positive-sum mindset not just for ourselves but for the next generation to come. That is indeed what will push our society forward.</p>
<br />
<p className="mb-4"><i>Competition is not just an economic concept or a simple inconvenience that individuals and companies must deal with in the marketplace. More than anything else, competition is an ideology — the ideology — that pervades our society and distorts our thinking. We preach competition, internalize its necessity, and enact its commandments; and as a result, we trap ourselves within it — even though the more we compete, the less we gain. — Zero to One, yet again.</i></p>
