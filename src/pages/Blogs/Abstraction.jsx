 <p className="mb-4">Do you know how speakers work?
A normal person: No.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Do you know how shampoo is processed? 
No</p>

<p className="mb-4">Do you want to know?
Not really.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Do we have an incentive to know? 
No.</p>

<p className="mb-4">An electronics repair shop can fix my speakers and my hair broadly feels clean after shampooing so why bother?</p>

<p className="mb-4">Today, we live in a highly abstracted world. We have no idea what happens underneath these devices.</p>

<h2 className="mb-4">What is abstraction?</h2>

<p className="mb-4">If you ever tasted a dish at a restaurant and wondered what ingredient made it taste bitter, you are a victim of abstraction. You have no idea what goes behind the kitchen door.</p>

<ul className="mb-4">
    <li className="mb-4">You shop online and make a payment. Next thing, you have a parcel at your doorstep in days, hours or now even in minutes. What you missed is the complex web of fulfillment centers, trucks and warehouses that your product had to travel. Hundreds of people were involved in making sure that the product you chose is the one you got.</li>
    <li className="mb-4">We press keys on the keyboard and see the changes on the screen. We don’t fully understand what happens within the millions of transistors switching between ones and zeros as the CPU processes your instructions at lightning speed.</li>
    <li className="mb-4">It’s easy to start a car and change gears with a few simple moves but we don’t have the remotest clue of how an automobile’s powertrain delivers the power from the internal combustion engine to the wheels (If you have an EV, that’s a different story).</li>
</ul>

<p className="mb-4">That is the magic of abstraction. If you’re reading the word “powertrain” for the first time, don’t worry, you’re completely normal. Today, the world is designed in such a way that you don’t need to know what is a powertrain and its mechanics.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Just because it’s not necessary to know, does that mean we shouldn’t even bother to try?</p>

<p className="mb-4">In this highly specialized world, you can somehow skim through life without knowing exactly how the internet impacts your day-to-day or how a beer is brewed.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Students often complain about studying minute details that are not relevant or applicable anymore. Unfortunately,</p>

<p className="mb-4"><strong>if you don’t know what is, you’ll never know what will be.</strong></p>

<ul className="mb-4">
    <li className="mb-4">If you don’t know the underlying equations used in an in-built function, you’ll never know why it’s not working.</li>
    <li className="mb-4">Observing lines of a graph is not enough to foresee the 10-year price of a stock. Only the investors who know the significance of each financial indicator, which made the graph look the way it is, will make themselves rich.</li>
    <li className="mb-4">You’ll never be able to predict the future of AI if you don’t know the fundamental concepts and assertions it’s built on.</li>
</ul>

<p className="mb-4">All things are built on first principles. Our capacity to break concepts down to first principles is gradually degrading. As a consequence, it hinders our ability to create, fix or build. Even though all of humanity’s knowledge is just a few clicks away for us, it’s crucial that we know these systems well enough to join the dots of different concepts so that we can innovate and improve when required.</p>

<p className="mb-4">I’m scared for the next generations to come. They may never know what it feels to type on a keyboard or cook your own food. Honestly, I’m scared for myself, there is so much knowledge that I have missed out on as a virtue of being born in this century.</p>

<p className="mb-4">On the flip side, maybe abstraction is what has brought us forward. It helps us focus on the important code and configurations ignoring the repetitive tasks. Progress makes our life easier at the cost of something tangible or intangible. The latter is hard to see, but becomes evident eventually.</p>
