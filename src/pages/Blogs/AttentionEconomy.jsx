<p className="mb-4 font-bold">“There are only two industries that call their customers “users”: drug trafficking and software.” — Edward Tufte</p>

<p className="mb-4">Economics is the study of how scarce resources are allocated. When one is asked to name a few scarce resources. They may think of:</p>


<ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 text-xl">
    <li className="text-xl">Oil</li>
    <li className="text-xl">Fresh water</li>
    <li className="text-xl">Vibranium?</li>
</ul>


<p className="mb-4">What about intangible resources?</p>

<p className="mb-4">In the early days, our ancestors would worry about not having enough food. Food was scarce. What is a scarce resource now?</p>

<p className="mb-4">It’s not food. (Agricultural revolution fixed that)</p>

<p className="mb-4">It’s not labour. (Industrial revolution resolved that issue)</p>

<p className="mb-4">It’s obviously not information. (Digital revolution took care of it.)</p>
<br />
<p className="mb-4">What do you wish to have more of in your life?</p>

<p className="mb-4">The most common answer is — We always wish we had more time, and paid attention to the important things in life because ultimately -</p>

<p className="mb-4">Time is scarce, and so is our attention.</p>
<br />
<h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl">Attention Economics</h2>

<p className="mb-4">An approach to the management of information that treats human attention as a scarce commodity and applies economic theory to solve various information management problems.</p>

<p className="mb-4">With limited resources and a capitalistic regime, there’s a race in the tech industry to extract more of our attention. Now, human attention is heavily capitalized.</p>

<p className="mb-4">“If you are not paying for a product then you are the product being sold.” — The Social Dilemma</p>

<p className="mb-4">Netflix CEO Reed Hasting unapologetically admitted that — <b>“The biggest competitor to Netflix is — Sleep”</b> i.e the human need to close their eyes for a third of the day.</p>

<p className="mb-4">This is how far the tech industry has taken over our lives.</p>
<br />
<h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl">Persuasive Technology</h2>

<p className="mb-4">Technology that is designed to change attitudes or behaviour of the users through persuasion and social influence but not necessarily through coercion.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Are they subconsciously influencing you and the decisions you make on a daily basis?</p>

<p className="mb-4">Assuming that you spend 2 hours on average on Social Media. (Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat etc. COMBINED) Which I must be clearly underestimating for an average 20 year old.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Let’s crunch the numbers: 2 hours a day, i.e 14 hours a week</p>
<br />
<h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl">Opportunity Cost</h2>
<p className="mb-4">Suppose an online course requires you to put in 4 hours per week. You could be doing 3 online courses simultaneously whilst building a project on the side!! But instead, you were watching reels.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Just give a thought about the opportunity cost of spending 60+ hours each month on an activity with a negative return on investment (considering it downgrades your attention span and cognitive function).</p>
<br />
<h2 className="mb-4">Are we better than fish?</h2>
<p className="mb-4">Studies say that the <b>average attention span is down from 12 seconds in the year 2000 to eight seconds now</b> . That is less than the nine-second attention span of your average goldfish.</p>

<p className="mb-4">These are the consequences at an individual level.
What about the consequences of persuasive technology at large?</p>

<p className="mb-4">False news spreads 6x times faster than true news and 4 billion new people will come online within 6 years.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, famous astrophysicist once said: “The number of stupid people remains the same. It’s just that now they can blog or tweet about it.”</p>

<h3 className="mb-4">Other notable consequences:</h3>

<ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 text-xl">
    <li className="text-xl">Addiction</li>
    <li className="text-xl">Polarization</li>
    <li className="text-xl">Radicalization</li>
</ul>

<p className="mb-4 italic">Imagine, for instance, that your network produces 200 posts a day of which you have time to read about 100. Because of the platform’s tilt, 
you will see the most outraged half of your feed. Next year, when 200 doubles to 400, you will see the most outraged quarter,
the year after that the most outraged eighth. Over time, your impression of your own community becomes radically more moralizing, aggrandizing, and outraged. — 
An excerpt from The Chaos Machine</p>
<br />
<h2 className="mb-4">Is this the beginning of a catastrophe?</h2>

<p className="mb-4">Yes, if we don’t take action as soon as possible.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Significant work is now being done towards developing more humane technology by focusing on the ethics of AI.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Now that you’re aware that your attention is scarce and a capitalized commodity. You can begin being more intentional with it.</p>

<p className="mb-4">If you’ve reached till here, congratulations! Your attention span is better than average!</p>
