In the early days, our ancestors would worry about not having enough food. Food was scarce. What is a scarce resource now?

It’s not food. (Agricultural revolution fixed that)

It’s not labour. (Industrial revolution resolved that issue)

It’s obviously not information. (Digital revolution took care of it.)

Attention Economics -

An approach to the management of information that treats human attention as a scarce commodity and applies economic theory to solve various information management problems.

With limited resources and a capitalistic regime, there’s a race in the tech industry to extract more of our attention. Now, human attention is heavily capitalized.
