    <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl">Chess</h2>
<p className="mb-4">Chess masters remember ridiculously many game-board positions. It’s truly a super-human capability.</p>
<p className="mb-4">When you set up a game board, initially, there is just one way to put all pieces. Just one standard set-up of the game.</p>
<p className="mb-4">After just 5 moves, there are 4.8 million different game-board positions possible (i.e. no of different possible games). After 3 more moves, that number slides up to <b>85 billion.</b></p>
<p className="mb-4">The possibilities only grow from there.</p>
<p className="mb-4">Claude Shannon, a renowned mathematician came up with 10¹²⁰ as roughly the number of different possible chess games. 1 quadrillion quadrillion is 10³⁰, so now you can imagine that the vastness of Shannon’s number. There are more ways to play chess than there are atoms in the observable universe.</p>
<p className="mb-4">One parallel to this game-tree complexity is referred in the book — Midnight Library by Matt Haig (Highly recommend).</p>
<br />
<h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl">Parallel Universes</h2>
<p className="mb-4">The author draws a parallel of playing the game of chess to playing the game of life. <i>Every move, every decision, just like 
a move on the chess board creates another branch in the tree, a parallel universe. </i> 
This universe is the one where you decided to study an extra hour for the exam, or where you chose to stay in 
touch with an old friend, or simply a universe where you woke up a minute earlier today morning.</p>
<p className="mb-4">It’s easy to fall into an existential dread of how the tiniest better or 
worse decision could lead you down a completely different trajectory. More importantly, every tiny decision you take 
now is shaping your universe. There are new universes diverging right now with every blink of your eye. It could quickly 
get very anxiety-inducing.</p>
<br />
<h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl">Road not taken</h2>
<p className="mb-4">The many-worlds interpretation (MWI) in quantum physics says that there are multiple versions of us living every 
life we possibly could’ve lived. Unfortunately, they are all light years away, so should we really be spending an ounce of energy 
thinking about them?</p>
<p className="mb-4">Earlier I used to believe that thinking counterfactually (shoulda, woulda, coulda) is futile. 
There are too many variables at play. After reading the book, my belief has solidified. The best is today. Regardless of whether you’re 12 or 78 years old, this is your call to read the "<a className="underline" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578297-the-midnight-library">Midnight Library</a>".</p>
