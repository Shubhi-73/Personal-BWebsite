Chess masters remember ridiculously many game-board positions. Itâ€™s truly a super-human capability.

When you set up a game board, initially, there is just one way to put all pieces. Just one standard set-up of the game.

After just 5 moves, there are 4.8 million different game-board positions possible (i.e. no of different possible games). After 3 more moves, that number slides up to 85 billion.

The possibilities only grow from there.</p>
