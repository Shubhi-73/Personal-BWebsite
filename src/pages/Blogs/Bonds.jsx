       <p className="mb-4">Imagine you’re the leader of Florence, Italy, back in the 14th or 15th century (Late Renaissance).</p>

<p className="mb-4">Florence was overall a wealthy city, attracting talented artists. However, wealth inequality was prevalent, and rich families (like the Medici) were high up on the wealth ladder.</p>

<p className="mb-4">The cities in Italy — Florence, Tuscany, Pisa — are all at war. There doesn’t seem to be an end to this.
Where do you find money to fund this war and protect the “glory” of Florence?</p>

<p className="mb-4">Take a moment to strategize. Ask yourself — <b>Who really has the money?</b></p>

<p className="mb-4 ">The rich families.</p>

<p className="mb-4">What if you could borrow money from these rich folks and keep giving them small payments (interests) at regular 
intervals (every month, or every year)? These regular payments keep them happy so that they don’t ask for their money back.</p>

<p className="mb-4">In a nutshell — Taking a Loan.</p>

<p className="mb-4">If at any point these rich people don’t want any interest payments and need their money back in full, you ask another rich family to borrow some money (in the name of war) so that you can pay the previous family back.</p>

<p className="mb-4">You keep doing this again and again in circles. Genius.</p>

<p className="mb-4">But how do you make sure that this agreement exists and is legitimate? You write it down on paper, and for fun, you decide to call this contract — “A bond”.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Initially, these bonds were just a line in a leather-bound ledger. Over time, they grew to become pieces of paper that the bondholder owns, to show that the government owes him money.</p>

<p className="mb-4">What are you doing exactly? You’re borrowing money from the rich and investing it to:</p>

<ul className="list-disc">
    <li className="text-xl">Fund the war</li>
    <li className="text-xl">Fund more infrastructural projects</li>
    <li className="text-xl">Pay for any government deficits (in case the budget exceeds the money raised through taxes)</li>
    <li className="text-xl">Use that money as interest payments to other bondholders.</li>
</ul>

<p className="mb-4">This strategy will keep you in debt forever. But ehh..won’t the government also last forever?</p>

<p className="mb-4">This story is not fictitious. This is precisely what happened in medieval Italy, which is considered as the origins of the bond market.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Today, this is precisely how corporations, governments, and agencies raise money through what we call “debt financing”. Certainly, this is an oversimplification, but the idea remains the crux of the bond market.</p>

<p className="mb-4">Congratulations! Now you belong to the small cohort of people who actually understand the fundamentals of bonds!</p>
